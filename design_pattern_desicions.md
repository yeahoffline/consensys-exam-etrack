# Design Pattern Desicions
Etrack is a energy tracking prototype for power plants. Energy data is written into virtual power meters. Next versions will include oracles to write energy data directly from wind turbines, solar parks etc. (out of scope for the "ConsenSys Academyâ€™s 2018 Developer Program Final Project").

Every power plant owner is able to deploy a separate smart contract to store power plants and energy data.
